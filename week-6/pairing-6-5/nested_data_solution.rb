# # Reflection
# What are some general rules you can apply to nested arrays?

  # When accessing them, the element indexes all need to be one after the other.  There arenâ€™t really any shortcuts.

# What are some ways you can iterate over nested arrays?

  # Good ways to iterate is using the each loop.  Then we used the is_a?(array) to tell us if the element is an array and if it was then we would do an each loop on the sub arrays.

# Did you find any good new methods to implement or did you re-use one you were already familiar with? What was it and why did you decide that was a good option?

  # is_a?(array) was very useful because it told us whether the element that was being iterated over with was a sub-array and if another iteration was necessary.  Then also the map! was very key to modify the array itself.
