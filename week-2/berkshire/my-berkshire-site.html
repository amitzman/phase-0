<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

Thought it was pretty awesome.  Just actaully being able to see how the HTML translates onto a page.  Seeingthe differences of all the tags and what they look like on an actual site.

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?

I used www.w3schools.com to research semantic HTML5 elements.  They have great examples of when to use the tags and how to use them.  I think at this point using the semantic elements was a great practice, but next week I will really get to see how effective they are when we apply CSS to format our page.


- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)

I took the extra few seconds to make sure I had a closing tag whenever I created an opening tag.  I also saved frequnetly and checked the actual site to check for any potential errors.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?

I think semantic markup is a good feature of HTML.  Helps keep creating a website well organized.  I think a bad feature about HTML would be that it doesn't always work on the internet browers.  Older browsers in particular, the HTML might not be supported.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?

At first, there would be times where I would always forget the closing tag. So I learned how to use the tab key as a shortcut when writing the tags because it also includes the closing tag.
