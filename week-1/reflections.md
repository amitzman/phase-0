# 1.1 Think About Time
The Pomodoro Effect and rhythm of flow were two time management and productivity ideas that stood out and I thought were very interesting.  The Pomodoro Effect is actually an example of “Time Boxing”, which is when a person allocates a certain period of time to complete a task/goal.  I like the idea of the Pomodoro Effect and how it is 25 minute time boxes followed by a five minute break.  I feel I could definitely apply this to each module throughout Phase 0 which I believe will help increase my productivity and efficiency.  My current strategy to manage my time is to make a checklist of tasks or goals that I set to achieve for the day and prioritize them.  While it does help me to be organized and on track, I can very easily get sidetracked and it ends up taking me much longer than it should to complete them all.  I still will employ my checklist because it does help me stay organized.  My overall plan for Phase 0 is to apply the Pomodoro Effect to my checklist of goals and make notes of when I’m in rhythm for my flow or when I’m out of rhythm.  Based on my reflections and notes, I can build on my productivity and efficiency week by week and will be well prepared for when Phase 1 begins.

# 1.2 The Command Line Reflection
**What is a shell? What is "bash?"**

A shell is an application program that provides a command-line interface to the operating system, allowing you to type commands of text and symbols and run them to create larger expressions.

Bash is a type of shell and serves as a command language interpreter.  Stands for Bourne Again SHell, because the previous shell that was widely used was called “sh” which was created by Stephen Bourne.



**What was the most challenging for you in going through this material?**

I’ve had some exposure to the command line in the past so some of it was a refresher for me, but the one thing that was challenging for was the section in regards to Pipes and Redirection.  I think this was more challenging concept for me because it involved control operators in addition to commands. This was something I had to go through several times to get a better understanding and something that I will need to practice more and more going forward.

**Were you able to successfully use all of the commands?**

Going through the crash course, I was able to use all of the commands without any issues.

**In your opinion, what are the most important commands and arguments to know?**

For me at this point, I believe pwd  or ls is the most important command.  I can very easily get lost or not quite remember which directory I’m in.  pwd allows me to know very quickly where I’m at and the ls command lets me know what contents are in directories.

**Can you remember what each of the following does of the top of your head? Write what each does.**

pwd - prints working directory

ls - list all the directories

mv - moves and renames directories

cd - change directories

../ - to return to the previous directory

touch - creates an empty file

mkdir - makes a directory

less - used to view the contents of a text file one page at a time.  The grep command can be used to find certain text or text string within the file and will return each line that contains the text.

rmdir - removes a directory

rm - removes a file

help - displays helpful information about built-in commands.
