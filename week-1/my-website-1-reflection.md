**Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.**

Creating a Repo

1. Log in to your Github account.  GitHub is a web-based hosting storage site for repositories.  Yourself and team members are able to access files through GitHub
2. Click on the ‘+’ and select “New repository”. This is in the upper right hand corner of the page next to your profile picture.
3. Name your repo a name. Like “phase-0”.
4. Give it a public or private access. If you have a free account then public is your only option.
5. If you want to be able to immediately clone a repo to your computer, then you need to select a license. Use “MIT License” for Rails and jQuery projects.
6. Click “Create repository”

Cloning a Repo

1. Login to your Github account
2. Go to your profile
3. Select which repo you would like to clone
4. In the terminal change to directories to where you would like to clone the repo.  The ternimal lives locally on your computer and it handles the version control by using Git.  Version control is keeping track of changes made to a file.
5. Copy the SSH clone URL or HTTPS clone URL to the clipboard from the repo page on Github
6. In the terminal type “git clone URL”. URL = paste what you copied into the clipboard

**Describe what open source means.**

Open source means that developers can have their work available to the world.  This allows other developers to take a look at the work and they are able to modifiy it.  Or someone could create an open project and the whole world can be a part of it and add code to it.

**What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?**

At this point for me it feels like utopia.  I love the idea, it makes me feel apart of a giant community of developers.  I think its greatly beneficial to be able to see other people's code because I believe it will allow me to see codes that I wouldn't have been able to see otherwise.

**Assess the importance of using licenses.**

Open source licenses allow software to be freely used and shared.  It allows other people to help you.  Also it will protect you as the original owner, making sure you get credit and it also prevents people from stealing  your work and claiming it as their own.  The licesne we've used so far is the MIT licesne which is the least restrictive license out there. This license allows anyone to do whatever they want with the licensed material.  So if you want your work to be open sourced you will need to choose a license based on what kind of permissions you would like to give to others.

**What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?**

Pushing, pulling, and merging were concepts that were solidfied for me.  The whole process is still a work in progress for me, but just by doing several times for each module has been great practice for me.  My 'aha' moment was just finally be able to see clearly what was being pushed, pulled, and merged.

**Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.**

Nope, the resources provided have been very useful and helpful so far.
